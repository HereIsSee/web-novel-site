                Night City, it's a place of endless wonders and horrors. 
                Opportunities and dangers, but before Motoko Kusanagi 
                can access any of them. She first has to build up enough 
                strength to walk again. Learn the basics of living in a 
                world that was just a game to her before. Good thing 
                she found a Shard hidden in her stuff that opens the 
                door of opportunity. But like all opportunities in Night 
                City, it usually ends up in a gunfight.
